        Matar paneer recipe is a popular Indian 
        Curry dish made with green peas and Paneer 
        (Indian cottage cheese) in a base of onions,
        tomatoes, cashews, spices and herbs. 
        The recipe hails from the versatile Northern 
        Indian cuisine that has many different (and 
        delicious) variations. I'm sharing our family 
        recipe of a flavorful and simple home-style 
        mutter paneer that you are going to like.
